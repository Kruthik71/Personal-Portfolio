# 🖥️ Terminal Portfolio

A unique and interactive **command-line style portfolio website** built with **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project simulates a terminal environment where visitors can type predefined commands to explore my experience, skills, projects, and more — giving a retro yet modern twist to personal branding.
